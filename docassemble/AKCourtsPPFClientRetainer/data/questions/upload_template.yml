  Client Signature Tool
subquestion: |
  Send your client a document to sign. You can choose from a form that's already
  part of the form library, or upload a new custom Microsoft Word file.

  To get a client's signature, you just need to add the exact text 
  `{{ client.signature }}` in the place where you want the signature to go. Click
  **Help** to learn about more fields you can include.
  
  This tool is experimental. Please use at your own risk.
fields:
  - Language: user_language
    choices:
      - English: en
      - Spanish: es
    default: en
  - no label: file_type
    input type: radio
    choices:
      - Use existing form letter or template: existing
      - Upload a new file: new
  - Choose an existing template: sp_file
    datatype: object
    choices: drive_contents
    show if:
      variable: file_type
      is: "existing"
  - Upload a template file: the_file
    show if: 
      variable: file_type
      is: "new"

  ### Collecting signatures
  Edit your Word file and type something like `{{advocate.signature}}` on the line
  in the file where you want the signature to appear.
  
  Like this: [FILE insert_signature.png]
  
  This tool knows about 4 kinds of people: 
  `client`, `advocate`, `individuals[0..n]`
  and `adverse_parties[0..n]`. (replace the number in the square brackets with any
  number to get information about several people)
    
  Referring to the variable name on its own adds the name of the client/advocate/person
  into the document. E.g., `{{client}}`. If you want to collect the signature, 
  add `.signature` to the variable's name.
  
  ### Information collected about people
  You can also refer to information about a person, such as their address. Usually you
  will use something like `{{ client.address.on_one_line() }}` or `{{client.address_block() }}`.

  ### Special fields
  To help you get a signature on a retainer, we added two fields you can use in any
  document: `{{ retainer_gbls_will }}` and `{{ retainer_client_costs }}`.
  
  You can also always use the special code `{{ today() }}` to make today's date
  appear in your document.
  
  ### Fields from Legal Server
  If you launch this interview from Legal Server, we'll gather as many of the fields
  as we can. That also includes fields like `client.address_block()`, 
  `client.phone_number`, `client.mobile_number`, `client.email`, and `client.birthdate`.
  
  Here is a full [list of the variables you can use from Legal Server](https://github.com/GBLS/docassemble-gbls/wiki/Available-Variable-Names).
